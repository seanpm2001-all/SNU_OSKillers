# ⚠ WARNING! ⚠

I had to change the extension on this file to one that wouldn't open in a web browser, because I accidentally ran this and it crashed my computer.

**THIS BUG IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO WINDOWS 95, IT WILL WORK ON ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AFTER WINDOWS 95**

I fear that if I change the extension, loading the script might cause Windows users on GitHub to experience a fatal system crash.

To make this script actually work, change the file extension from what it currently is: `.htmlllllll`

to any of the following:

`.htm` `.html` `.xhtm` `.xhtml` `.mhtm` `.mhtml`

As of July 4th 2020, this bug has not been patched, and your system will crash if you are running any version of Windows from Windows 95 and up (and also possibly Windows NT 3.51/Windows 3.11 and below, I haven't tested it yet on versions preceeding to Windows 95)

If you are to run this, please do it in a virtual machine. Here are some virtual machines you can try if you don't have one:

> [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - I recommend this one, and I use it myself. It is free and open source, and can handle most operating systems, including every version of Microsoft Windows, most Linux distributions, Solaris, BSD, partial MacOS support, and more.

> [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) - This is Microsoft Windows exclusive, it is a virtual machine hypervisor that comes with professional and enterprise editions of Windows 10

> [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) - I don't know too much about this one, but it is a highly trusted one by many companies, including Dell. I have seen many people use it successfully, I don't use it myself though.

> [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) - This is a virtual machine manager for more professional computer users. I am going to try it some day, I have heard good things about it.

Proceed with caution. I am not responsible for any damage caused by people not reading these instructions.
